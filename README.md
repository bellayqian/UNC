Funded by Michael P. and Jean W. Carter Research Award administered by Honors Carolina

These are codes for Yunzhe Qian's UNC Senior Honor Thesis (designated in April 2022 with Highest Honor). 

Used scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data. We compared joint analysis (collect multiple data types in the same cell, analyze jointly) and integrated analysis (treat joint datasets as if they were not from the same cell. Computationally CCA-based integrate RNA and ATAC datasets) using DORC numbers (high-density peak-gene associations that are enriched for lineage-determine genes).
